A simple player for audio files.  At first we are trying to get it working with quite simple controls only.

Behavior:

* Pause and resume track
* Show progress bar of current track
* Show cover art if available
* Show available audio files ?
* Next track (in folder ?)
* Previous track (in folder ?)
