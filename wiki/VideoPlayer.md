A simple player for video files.  At first we are trying to get it working with quite simple controls only.

Behavior:

* Pause and resume video playback
* Show progress bar of current video
* Show video minimized (if played on local device)
* Show video in fullscreen (if played on local device)
* Show available video files ?
* Next video (in folder ?)
* Previous video (in folder ?)
